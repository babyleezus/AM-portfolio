My portfolio

This is my personal portfolio intended to showcase the work that I have undertaken during my front end development bootcamp. 
On this page you will be links to each individual project which will redirect you to the corresponding project github repository. Here prospective employers or collaborators will be able to view my work to better understand my capabilities as a developer and the services I am able to offer. 

- When the page is loaded my name, an avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, contact information appear
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- My first application's is larger in size than the others
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to the viewport
