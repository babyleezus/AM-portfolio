      <p>Now, this is a story all about how
        My life got flipped-turned upside down
        And I'd like to take a minute
        Just sit right there
        I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In West Philadelphia born and raised, On the playground was where I spent most of my days.Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool. And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air". 
        I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air".
        I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
        And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later". I looked at my kingdom. I was finally there
        To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
